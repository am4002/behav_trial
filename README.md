N-back beavioral trial scripts for 2016 MEG connectivity study

FOR SUBJECTS PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY:
- this program is a series of N-back cognitive tests
- N-back tests are simple; you view a series of stimuli (either coloured squares or short audio tones) and indicate
(by pressing the 'L' key) if the stimuli matches some criteria, as dictated by the test.
- if you have any questions about the nature of the tests, ask one of the experimenters
- additional information about each type of N-back test is provided within the test framework before the test begins
- you will be given a subject ID by the experimenter, please enter it in the dialouge box that appears when you start 
the test program; if you do not have a subject ID, shamelessly bother an experimenter till you are given one
